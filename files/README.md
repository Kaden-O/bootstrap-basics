Project: Knowledge Check | Bootstrap Basics, Utilities, Forms, and Components

1. I started with the navbar. I took the navbar layout in bootstrap docs and modified it a bit for the project. I changed the background color of the navbar, the logo 
color as well as the word colors I changed so it would look more appealing.

2. Then I worked on the registration form. I started with first and last name. I used col-6 so they would be next to eachother horizontally. Then I made the email, 
password, and a checkbox button. Then I created a green submit button using btn-success.

3. Then I moved on to make the data section. I made the table and used bootstrap components to make it look nice. I added striped and hoverable rows for better readability. 

4. Then I moved on to the image section. I was able to get the rounded circle no problem but the responsive image was giving me some diffuculty. I had the image with the img-fluid class and in a container-fluid class but it was not appearing. I then got help from Daniel and told me to put w-100 in the class with img-fluid, and it worked in the moment. The image was appearing full width and everything until I log on one day and suddenly the image is no longer there and instead the alternative text is shown. I did not mess with the code after Daniel had helped me so I am unsure as to why it is appearing like this.

5. Then I moved on to the button section. I started with making the first button which is visible on all screen sizes and is blue. I then created the second button which will dissapear on small screen sizes and has a gray border.

6. I then double checked everything and made sure everything was responsive and working properly.
